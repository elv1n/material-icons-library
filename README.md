## Imports

- If your environment doesn't support tree-shaking, the **recommended** way to import the icons is the following:
```jsx
import AccessAlarmIcon from '@material-ui/icons/AccessAlarm';
import AddLocationIcon from '@material-ui/icons/AddLocation';
```

- If your environment support tree-shaking you can also import the icons this way:
```jsx
import { AccessAlarm, AddLocation } from '@material-ui/icons';
```

Note: Importing named exports in this way will result in the code for *every icon* being included in your project, so is not recommended unless you configure [tree-shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/). It may also impact Hot Module Reload performance.
